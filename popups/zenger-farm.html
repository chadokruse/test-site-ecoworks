  <p>However, the program has a particular focus on serving disadvantaged youth in outer Southeast Portland. Lents, the neighborhood that is home to Zenger Farm, has been federally designated as "blighted," and has a large low-income population.</p>
  <p>Through the program, Zenger develops long-term relationships with individual teachers to bring students to the farm one or more times though the season. Program goals include providing a transformative experience for youth, and a strong, science-based curriculum that supports and reinforces teachers' work in the classroom. </p>
  <p>Students come to the farm and experience the fields and greenhouses, wetlands, wildlife and food. They learn the components of soil, learn the role of worms, explore how food is grown and, best of all, snack on fresh produce. One young girl on the farm even said that her "favorite part of the day was eating cauliflower!". </p>
  <p>Students take part in hands-on activities such as planting seeds, taking water samples and catching and observing garden bugs. These activities are an exciting break from classwork, and an experience that students and teachers can share. There is no question that kids love the farm. One student stated recently that he wanted to "stay here forever".</p>
  <p>But to reach its potential, Zenger Farm must continue to develop its staff capacity and infrastructure. Over the past three years, the Youth Education Program has been implemented through a partnership with the Northwest Service Academy. A full-time AmeriCorps volunteer played a primary role in providing education and service learning activities at the Farm. Volunteers have also helped research, revise and pilot curricula in the field. This has been an amazing opportunity for Zenger and the volunteers; however AmeriCorps limits engagement in any one program to three years.</p>
  <p>To fill that gap, Ecoworks and Friends of Zenger Farms have partnered to provide the necessary funding for a full time staff member to focus on the Youth Education Program.  With this funding Zenger can increase the number of students participating in the program and create for students'a life-long awareness and appreciation for the earth and our food system.</p>
