  <p>The Foundation has funded the development of a middle school curriculum resource guide documenting Portland Public Schools' Environmental Middle School.  The EMS curriculum teaches young people the core principals of environmental conservation through class and community work.</p>
  <p>Excerpt from resource guide:  "Characteristics of Environmental Education."</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Environmental Education incorporates a human component to exploring environmental problems and their solutions.  These solutions are not only scientific - they include historical, political, economic and cultural perspectives.</li>
    <li>Environmental Education rests on a foundation of knowledge about social and ecological systems.</li>
    <li>Knowledge lays the groundwork for analyzing environmental problems, resolving conflicts, and preventing new problems from arising.</li>
    <li>Environmental Education includes the affective domain:  the attitudes, volues, and commitments necessary to build a sustainable society.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ecoworks Foundation is now working with the creator of this resource guide to investigate the possibilities in promoting this successful curriculum more broadly.</p>
