        <p>Ecoworks Foundation is founded on the premise that economic systems are the most effective drivers for change.  The Foundation's operational philosophy is to employ business methodologies to drive measurable progress toward the Foundation's goals.</p>
        <p>Ecoworks Foundation intends, through investments in education and research, to fulfill its mission of promoting sustainable development.  The Foundation is principally interested in promoting positive change in our world through activities in two key areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Research:</strong> Ecoworks Foundation supports new and ongoing research projects, ideally within Oregon initially, that are consistent with its core mission of promoting sustainable development.  Viable projects include research projects that develop new technologies or validate the economic viability of new or existing technologies.  Suitable technologies enable economic growth and foster environmental replenishment.</li>
          <li><strong>Education:</strong> Education represents the primary investment that we must make both in support of our future and to enable any positive change.  The Foundation recognizes in its charter that education is ultimately the primary tool we have in achieving our goals. The Foundation seeks to promote the teaching of future generations to live more sustainably and to encourage the invention of technologies that promote harmony with our environment thus ensuring a habitable planet for future generations.</li>
